#2.2(f) Plotting the boxplot
boxplot(ages)

#2.2(g) quantile plots norm the data by plotting their percentage values, where 25%=Q1, 75%=Q3, etc.
#this prepares it to be compared to other data with different values and different mins & maxes.
#The percentage values are on the X axis, and the raw values are on the Y axis.
#quantile-quantile plots, however, map data to another comparable data series. They must have
#equal number of data points for this comparison. Then we can compare the value from each data
#set at qantile 1 (Q1), quantile 3 (Q3), etc.
#The data points correspond to percentages, and the raw values appear on both X and Y axes.
