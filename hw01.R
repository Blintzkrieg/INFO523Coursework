#2.2(g) quantile plots norm the data by plotting their percentage values, where 25%=Q1, 75%=Q3, etc.
#this prepares it to be compared to other data with different values and different mins & maxes.
#The percentage values are on the X axis, and the raw values are on the Y axis.
#quantile-quantile plots, however, map data to another comparable data series. They must have
#equal number of data points for this comparison. Then we can compare the value from each data
#set at qantile 1 (Q1), quantile 3 (Q3), etc.
#The data points correspond to percentages, and the raw values appear on both X and Y axes.

#2.3  Approximate median value.
#using formula (2.3) on page 46 of the textbook.
#where 21 is the lower boundary of the median interval, 
#3194 is number of values in the entire dataset, 
#950 is the sum of the frequencies of all the intervals that are lower than the median interval (200+450+300), 
#and 29 is the median's bin width.
#the midpoint is 55.5, which would fall in bin "51-80", but we know the median is going to be in the bin with highest frequency, "21-50".
